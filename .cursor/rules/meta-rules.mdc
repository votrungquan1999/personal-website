# Meta Rules

These rules MUST always be followed unless explicitly overridden.  
For each task, Cursor MUST double-check:

1. Which rules were applied.
2. Whether any relevant rules were missed.
3. If any rule conflicts exist, resolve them explicitly.

- ALWAYS check all applicable rules before making any changes.
- ALWAYS explain which rules were applied in the output.
- MUST keep files under **300 lines** for AI context management.
- NEVER require running/building the server to validate output.
- NEVER run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` after completing tasks, the user will handle this.
- ALWAYS use `npm install` to install packages. NEVER add packages directly to `package.json`.
- AI MAY replace entire components or structures if it improves clarity/compliance.
- For complex changes, AI MUST ask:
  - "Am I correct?"
  - "Which rules apply here?"
  - "Did I miss any relevant rules?"
- Apply the multi-shot method of prompt engineering: After editing around 5 files, should ask the user to review if the current direction is correct, then continue with the next 5 files. This iterative feedback approach helps ensure the AI stays aligned with user expectations and corrects course early if needed.

## Scope Management

- NEVER implement unused/future features not explicitly requested by the user.
- MUST ask 1-2 clarifying questions before implementing (or more if user explanation >100 characters).
- Focus on what exists in the system currently, not what could be extended unless explicitly requested by the user.
- When user provides long explanations (>100 characters), ask additional clarifying questions to verify scope and approach before proceeding.

## Error Handling

- NEVER use try-catch blocks defensively around every operation.
- ONLY place try-catch blocks at intentional error boundaries where you want to catch all errors from lower-level code.

## Planning Mode

- When in planning mode and a `.md` file has already been generated, ALWAYS create a new file for any plan changes requested by the user.
- NEVER modify the existing `.md` file when the user requests changes to the plan.
